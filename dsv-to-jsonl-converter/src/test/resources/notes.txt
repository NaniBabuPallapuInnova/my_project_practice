Certainly! Let's go through each dependency and plugin in your Maven `pom.xml` file and explain their functionality and purpose:

### Dependencies:

1. **Apache Commons CSV (`org.apache.commons:commons-csv:1.9.0`)**:
   - Functionality: This dependency provides classes and utilities for working with CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files.

3. **JSON (`org.json:json:20210307`)**:
   - Functionality: This dependency provides a simple JSON library for Java.
   - Purpose: It allows your application to work with JSON data, such as creating JSON objects and parsing JSON strings.

4. **Logback Classic (`ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:1.2.5`)**:
   - Functionality: Logback is a logging framework for Java. Classic module provides SLF4J binding.
   - Purpose: It allows your application to log messages, warnings, and errors with different log levels and configure logging behavior.

5. **JUnit (`junit:junit:3.8.1`)**:
   - Functionality: JUnit is a popular unit testing framework for Java.
   - Purpose: It allows you to write and execute unit tests for your Java code.

6. **TestNG (`org.testng:testng:RELEASE`)**:
   - Functionality: TestNG is another testing framework for Java, offering additional features compared to JUnit.
   - Purpose: It provides an alternative to JUnit for writing and executing tests, including support for parameterized tests, test grouping, and test configuration.

### Build Plugins:

1. **Maven Compiler Plugin (`org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-compiler-plugin:3.8.1`)**:
   - Functionality: This plugin configures the Java compiler settings for your Maven project.
   - Purpose: It specifies the Java source and target versions to use during compilation.

2. **Maven Assembly Plugin (`org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-assembly-plugin:3.3.0`)**:
   - Functionality: This plugin allows you to create an assembly of your project, bundling dependencies and other files into an archive.
   - Purpose: It's commonly used to create executable JAR files with dependencies bundled, making it easier to distribute and run standalone Java applications.

### Additional Explanations:

- **`<scope>test</scope>`**: This element specifies the scope of the dependency. Dependencies with scope `test` are only available for use during testing and are not included in the production code.

- **`<mainClass>com.example.App</mainClass>`**: This configuration in the Maven Assembly Plugin specifies the main class to be used when running the generated JAR file. Adjust the value (`com.example.App`) to match your main class.

These dependencies and plugins are essential components for developing and testing Java applications with Maven, providing functionalities for working with CSV and JSON data, logging, unit testing, and building executable JAR files.



### Project Structure:

- **src/main/java/com/example/dsvtojsonl/Converter.java**: This class contains the logic for converting a DSV (Delimiter-Separated Values) file into JSONL (JSON Lines) format. It uses Apache Commons CSV library (`org.apache.commons.csv.CSVParser` and `org.apache.commons.csv.CSVRecord`) to parse the DSV file and convert each record into a JSON object. Dates are formatted using `SimpleDateFormat`. The method `convertDSVtoJSONL()` takes input file path and output file path as parameters and performs the conversion.

- **src/main/java/com/example/dsvtojsonl/Main.java**: This class contains the `main()` method, which serves as the entry point of the application. It reads command-line arguments for input and output file paths, then calls `Converter.convertDSVtoJSONL()` method to perform the conversion.

- **src/test/java/com/example/dsvtojsonl/ConverterTest.java**: This class contains unit tests for `Converter` class. It tests the conversion logic with sample input files.

### Maven Configuration:

- **pom.xml**: This file is used for configuring the Maven project. It specifies project metadata, dependencies, and build configuration. In this project, we have dependencies on Apache Commons CSV library for handling CSV files. We also configure Maven to build a standalone JAR with dependencies using the `maven-assembly-plugin`.

### Code Explanation:

#### Converter.java:

- **convertDSVtoJSONL(String inputFile, String outputFile)**: This method takes the input DSV file path and output JSONL file path as parameters. It reads the DSV file using `Files.newBufferedReader()` and parses it using `CSVParser`. For each record in the DSV file, it converts the record to a JSON object using `convertRecordToJSON()` method and writes the JSON object to the output file.

- **convertRecordToJSON(CSVRecord record)**: This method converts a single CSV record (represented as `CSVRecord` object) to a JSON object (`JSONObject`). It iterates over each field in the record and handles special formatting for the "dateOfBirth" field, parsing it using `SimpleDateFormat` and converting it to the required format. Other fields are added directly to the JSON object.

#### Main.java:

- **main(String[] args)**: This is the entry point of the application. It checks if the correct number of command-line arguments is provided. If arguments are correct, it calls `Converter.convertDSVtoJSONL()` method with input and output file paths. It handles exceptions if any occur during the conversion process.

#### ConverterTest.java:

- **testConversion()**: This method tests the conversion logic of `Converter` class. It specifies the input DSV file path and output JSONL file path, then calls `Converter.convertDSVtoJSONL()` method to perform the conversion. Assertions can be added to verify the correctness of the conversion output.

### Inbuilt Classes and Libraries Used:

- **java.nio.file.Files**: Used for file I/O operations, specifically reading input DSV file.
- **org.apache.commons.csv.CSVParser** and **org.apache.commons.csv.CSVRecord**: Used for parsing DSV files.
- **java.text.SimpleDateFormat**: Used for parsing and formatting dates.
- **org.json.JSONObject**: Used for creating JSON objects.

### Functionality:

1. **Reading DSV File**: The project reads a DSV file line by line using `CSVParser` without loading the entire file into memory.

2. **Converting to JSON**: Each line of the DSV file is converted to a JSON object, where field names are keys and corresponding values are values.

3. **Formatting Dates**: Dates are formatted from DSV format to the specified JSON format.

4. **Writing JSONL File**: The JSON objects are written to the output file line by line in JSONL format.

5. **Command-line Interface**: The project can be executed from the command line by providing input and output file paths as arguments.

6. **Unit Testing**: The conversion logic is unit tested using JUnit to ensure correctness.

Overall, the project demonstrates a simple yet robust way to convert DSV files to JSONL format while adhering to specified requirements, including streaming processing and dynamic data handling.
