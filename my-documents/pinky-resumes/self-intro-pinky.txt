While coming to my family, my late father was Bandi Anjaneyulu, and my mother is Bandi Pavani, who works as a beautician. 
I also have a younger sister currently studying in the second year of intermediate.

I am skilled in Spring Boot framework and have practical experience in personal project, showcasing adaptability and problem-solving skills.


One of my notable projects is "HAND WAVE TALK," a wearable glove designed for individuals with disabilities who communicate using sign language. 
This innovative solution uses flex sensors to detect hand movements and translates sign language into digital signals, contributing to inclusive communication.

I have also worked on the "STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM," a comprehensive Java Full-Stack Project that efficiently manages student information through CRUD operations. 
This project reflects my proficiency in Java, Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and MySQL.

Now coming to me, I am sweet smart, confident, and hardworking person. 
I am a cool hearted person, so usually see every difficulty with a positive side and keep myself always smiling which makes me stronger even more.

I can carry out any task assigned to me without hesitation.

My hobbies are classical dancing, playing Chess, listening to music. In my spare time, I like to read news on my phone and traveling to my hometown.

My short term goal is to secure a position as a fresher in an IT company, aiming to apply the skills I've acquired and bring happiness to my family.

My long term goal is to build a successful and fulfilling career in IT. I hope to take on more responsibilities and contribute significantly to projects and teams.


My mom, a single parent, she is my inspiration. Despite facing challenges, she remains strong, never giving up, and always wearing a smile. Her resilience teaches me the power of staying positive and enduring through tough times

Thank you for giving this opportunity to introduce myself.
